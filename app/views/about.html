        <h2>Some technical points on the implementation</h2>
        <p>This is a capstone project and a personal exploration of the possibilities offered by JavaScript. These are some of the achievements:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> <img src="./app/assets/img/guidepost.svg" alt="guide post icon"> It is a Single Page Application. It implements a router that imports the views according to the route in a single HTML file, without using frameworks.</li>

                <li> <img src="https://www.coingecko.com/favicon-96x96.png" class="coin-gecko-logo" alt="coingecko logo"> Uses multiple enpoints from the CoinGecko API. Sometimes combining two and processing the information to complete a task.</li>
                 
                <li> <img src="./app/assets/img/json-file-logo.svg" alt="json file logo"> Implements models based on javascript data structures. Classes for Coins and Users are used to build objects that are stored in arrays.</li>
                
                <li> <img src="https://codereviewvideos.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/es6-logo-483x510.png" alt=""> Uses modern ES6 syntax to manipulate classes and arrays and declare functions</li>
                
                <li> <img src="./app/assets/img/database.svg" alt="database logo">  Uses locale storage as a database. Each User has a Wallet and a Transactions Record, besides his personal information, and all this is kept in locale storage.</li>
                <li> <img src="./app/assets/img/auth.svg" alt="authentication logo"> In this way, an authentication and session system is also implemented. Some parts of the application are only accessible to users. The application recognizes which user has logged in and displays information accordingly.</li>
                <li> <img src="https://www.chartjs.org/img/chartjs-logo.svg" alt=""> Uses the libraries "Highcharts" and "Chart.js" to render interactive charts based on the information stored in its database or received from the API.</li>
